    <p>I really like the how to train your dragon seires. Because Toothless is super cute and reminds me of my dog
    <p>I also used to watch it with my sister and it's kinda a bond we share since we watched all six seasons of the how to train your dragon show on netflix
    <p>The third movie was so good and I was so sad that it ended. My sister and I were crying our eyes out and couldn't leave the theaters until after the credits were finished.
